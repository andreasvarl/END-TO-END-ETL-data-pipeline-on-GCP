# END-TO-END-ETL-data-pipeline-on-GCP

This Project showcases my implementation of an end-to-end ETL pipeline using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to manage and analyze weather data.This project emphasizes my capabilities in using cloud technologies and data engineering practices to handle real-world data workflows effectively.

## 🎯 Objective

Build an end-to-end data pipeline that:
1. Extracts data from an external API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
2. Loads the data into **BigQuery**.
3. Visualizes the data using **Looker Studio**.
4. Runs at zero or minimal cost (using GCP’s free-tier).
